                Hello! My name is Thomas Bivins and I am an undergraduate student at the University of South Florida currently majoring in Computer Engineering. 
                I currently work in web development in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/usfcsdl" class="">USF Computational Sociodynamics Lab</a> for the purpose of testing a custom algorithm for delivering information to people's Twitter feeds. 
                I have a great passion for Computer Science and Engineering and find that I learn something new every day. 
                Aside from school, I also have a multitude of hobbies and personal programming projects that I am always working on. 
                For further inquiries, feel free to contact me. Thanks! 
            </p>
